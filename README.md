The end goal of this project is to be a definitive api and collection of the mascots of Japan.

It will be a collaboration between myself and my husband, with myself handling the front end and him handling the back end.

Our #1 challenge is data.  Datasets for mascots don't really exist, we so will be using the great Google and the help of Twitter account @mondomascots to collect our data.

Step 1: Collect all available data into a JSON object.


### Want to help with data collection?

We set up a google form for submissions!  Its easy to fill out, and you can give us as much or as little info as you find!  All we require is a name in English or Japanese, a link to a photo, the prefecture the mascot is from (put i dont know if you have all the other info) and a description.  The description can be your own words for what it looks like, or the official description.

[Submit info here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffUOc13-XKV43_iUsq2nBJIRbh76GWGy30RFS2kv5tEyErIw/viewform?usp=sf_link) and you will definitely receive credit for your submission

### Milestones
11/13/2019 - We officially have 175 mascots logged! And about 375 in the backlog.
