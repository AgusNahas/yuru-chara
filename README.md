The end goal of this project is to be a definitive api and collection of the mascots of Japan.

It will be a collaboration between myself and my husband, with myself handling the front end and him handling the back end.

Our #1 challenge is data.  Datasets for mascots don't really exist, we so will be using the great Google and the help of Twitter account @mondomascots to collect our data.

Step 1: Collect all available data into a JSON object.
